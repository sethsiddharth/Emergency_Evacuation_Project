The object of this project is to design a virtual infrastructure taking the number of people and size of the structure as parameters to simulate evacuation process using agent based modelling (swarm intelligence) to avoid stampede by placing the exit gates, pillars, etc. at strategic locations.

The following code is written in NetLogo programming language (using NetLogo 3D 4.1.2).

PS: NetLogo is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment and which can be downloaded from http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ .
If you face any difficulty in interpreting the code feel free to drop me a mail at siddharthseth007@gmail.com.
